	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p> These iconic little sweetrolls have become a staple within the world of Tamriel, and with good reason. They’re light, fluffy, and just dripping with that thick icing. The recipe might make four, but that doesn’t mean four servings by any stretch.</p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2> 
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>3/4 cup warm milk</li>
		<li>2 Tbs. honey</li>
		<li>Pinch of salt</li>
		<li>2 tsp. dry active yeast</li>
		<li>3 Tbs. butter</li>
		<li>1 egg</li>
		<li>1 ½ cups flour</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2> For the frosting </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>2 Tbs. cream cheese, softened</li>
		<li>1 Tbs. unsalted butter, softened</li>
		<li>2 Tbs. heavy cream</li>
		<li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2> Steps </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Set oven to 350f. combine the warm milk and honey, stirring until the honey has dissolved. add the salt and yeast, followed by the remaining ingredients. mixing completely until you have a smooth batter. spoon evenly into a 5” miniature bundt pan. allow to rise for 30 minutes, then bake for 15 minutes.</li>
		<li>While the rolls bake, make up the frosting by creaming together the cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar. gradually add just enough heavy cream to get a smooth, thick icing that barely runs off a spoon.</li>
		<li>When the rolls are finished baking, allow to cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then tip out onto a cooling rack. when they are completely cooled, spoon the icing over the tops of the buns, letting it run down the sides a little.tbs. cream cheese, softened</li>
	</ol>
