	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>Originally a Khajiit dish, this pudding has evolved without the moonsugar, letting the natural sweet flavors of the honey shine through. Different varieties of honey will each give a slightly different flavor, depending on the flowers it was made from.</p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2> 
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>2 cups whole milk</li>
		<li>1 whole vanilla bean, or 1 tsp. extract</li>
		<li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
		<li>1/2 cup honey</li>
		<li>1 cup heavy cream or whipping cream</li>
		<li>3 Tbs. cornstarch</li>
		<li>3 egg yolks</li>
		<li>pinch salt</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h2> Steps </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Pour the milk into a medium pot over medium heat.</li>
		<li>Split the vanilla bean down the middle with a sharp knife and scrape out the seeds.</li>
		<li>Add the seeds and the pod to the pot of milk, and bring to just under a boil. Add the sugar and honey, and stir for a few minutes to allow the vanilla to steep into the milk.</li>
		<li>Fish out the pod, scrape any remaining seeds from it, and discard.</li>
		<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the heavy cream, cornstarch, egg yolks, and salt. While still whisking, pour a little of the hot milk into the bowl to temper the mixture, then pour everything back into the pot.</li>
		<li>Cook for around 5 minutes more, stirring all the while, until the mixture has thickened noticeably.</li>
		<li>Remove from heat, strain into a clean bowl, and cover with plastic. Chill for at least an hour to help the pudding set.</li>
	</ol>
