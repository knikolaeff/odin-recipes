	<h2> Description </h2>
	<p>Originally only known in Vvardenfell, this recipe traveled with Dunmer fleeing Morrowind after the Red Mountain's eruption and has been well received throughout much of Tamriel, albeit with various regional tweaks to the ingredient list. The lightly seasoned filling and crisp crust can satisfy even the pickiest palate.</p>
	<h2> Ingredients </h2> 
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>1 cup flour</li>
		<li>pinch of salt</li>
		<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
		<li>cold water, enough for dough</li>
		<li>1 Tbs. salted butter</li>
		<li>1-2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 medium tomatoes, 1 chopped, 2 sliced, divided</li>
		<li>one medium kwama egg, or 4 chicken eggs</li>
		<li>1/2 cup milk</li>
		<li>1 cup grated cheddar cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
		<li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Steps </h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Start off by making up the dough- Whisk the salt and olive oil into the flour, then gradually add just enough water to bring the mixture together.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 350F. Roll out the pie dough to about 1/8â€³ thickness, and gently drape over a tart or pie pan. Press into the bottom and sides, and trim off any excess. Prick the bottom of the pastry with a fork to prevent it from bubbling up.</li>
		<li>Melt the butter in medium skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for several minutes, until slightly browned. Add the tomatoes and cook for another few minutes, until the tomatoes are soft, but not yet falling apart.</li>
		<li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, cheese and salt. Pour this mixture into the pastry shell, then top evenly with the tomatoes. Bake for about an hour, or until the top is golden and puffy. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
